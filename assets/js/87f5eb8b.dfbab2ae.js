To mitigate this risk, an operator should pin specific versions of the docker image or commits of the repository that have been thoroughly tested and accepted by the community and the operator's security team. Due to the independent nature of Distributed Validator Clusters, every cluster does not need to upgrade versions in lock-step, allowing a cautious operator or cluster to vet and test any potential release candidate for as long as they need. Further, it is possible to gradually roll out new versions of the charon software to a subset of your production nodes before upgrading a signing supermajority of the nodes in your cluster.
